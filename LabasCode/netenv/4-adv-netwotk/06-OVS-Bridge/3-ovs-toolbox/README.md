# ovs-toolbox
ovs-toolbox.py is a graphical user interface for Open vSwitch (OvS).

![header](https://github.com/nbonnand/ovs-toolbox/blob/master/src/wiki/header2.jpg)

OvS bridges managed by this GUI, do not necessarily need to be local to your host. 
(They can be located on AWS, GCP, etc.. and managed remotely by this GUI via ssh/paramiko/sudo ) 

In addition, this GUI will help you with docker and KVM ecosystems (for simple tasks like connecting containers and VMs to OvS).

- bridge creation
- port/interface creation ( vlan, interface types, etc..)
- port statistics
- ingress policy
- mirroring
- bonding
- RSTP, STP
- multicast
- flows (netflow,sflow,ipfix)
- queues and QOS
- OpenFlow flows
- OpenFlow groups
- various OvS databases (controller, manager, Open_vSwitch, ssl )

Docker related settings that you can manage with this GUI:
- docker files creation
- docker image creation, docker image build
- docker run, stop and rm
- docker inspect
- docker containers network parameters and automatic connection to selected OvS through one or multiple network interfaces.
